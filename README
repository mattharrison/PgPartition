PgPartition
============

Script to help generate SQL to deal with Postgres partitions.

One can run the script from the command line or use it as a library to
generate sql.

Once you have more than 2 partitions, you don't want to be typing in
commands for every partitioned table.


Postgres Partitions
--------------------

See the Postgres docs for information about partitions.

http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/interactive/ddl-partitioning.html

This script allows you to generate the code necessary to do what's
mentioned above.

Using PgPartition
------------------

PgPartition assumes one has a "master table" that they want to
partition.  Partitioning is done on a column that is an integer/long
type.  You can specify the start value, end value and stride for the
partitions.  (Basically the same as Python slicing, ie end value is up
to but not including).  See ``--help`` for the options which include:

* DDL to create partitioned tables
* DDL to drop partitioned tables
* Insert function creation
* Insert trigger creation
* Drop trigger (if re-partitioning)
* Index creation
* Index dropping
* Arbitrary SQL (if you want to vacuum the partitioned tables, etc)
